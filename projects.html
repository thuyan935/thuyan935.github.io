        <h4 class="game_description">
            A game that prompts the user to guess a number between 1-20.
            Conditional statements are used to provide the user with hints to guess
            higher or lower based on the user's entry. There is also a high score
            feature which updates based on how many attempts it takes the user to
            guess correctly.

            One of my favourite past times is shopping, however, it can be
            difficult to know where to find the best prices for certain items.
            Accordingly, this project explores web scrapping using Python to scrap
            data from two clothing sites. The user can enter a particular item
            which they are looking for such as "dress" or "shirt" The code will
            then provide a dictionary of all items that match the keywords
            provided to allow the user to compare prices of similar items across
            different stores.
